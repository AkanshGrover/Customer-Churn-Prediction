## Customer Churn Prediction
**Overview**

As part of my machine learning internship, I have been tasked with creating a model that predicts customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. The model utilizes a TF-IDF Vectorizer in conjunction with a Random Forest Classifier for performing the classification. A graphical user interface has been developed using PySide6 to make the application user-friendly.

**Project Structure**

 - `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training the model.
 - `model/`: Stores the trained machine learning model.
 - `ui/`: Stores .ui files created using pyside6-designer.
 - `main.py`: Main code for data preprocessing, feature extraction and model training.
 - `mainui.py`: The code for the GUI.

**Prerequisites**

 1. Python
 2. Required libraries: pandas, numpy, chardet, scikit-learn, PySide6

**Running the Application**
1) Clone or download the repository.
2) If downloaded then extract it to a folder, if cloned then just skip this step.
3) Install dependencies if needed.
4) Open the terminal in the extracted folder and run the following:
`python -u "main.py"`
